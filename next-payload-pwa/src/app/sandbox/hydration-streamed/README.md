## TL;DR

- Doesnt work! Still requests users on client-side.
- Commenter `Stas on July 24, 2023` points this out but the author has not updated his article to save people wasting their time ðŸ™„
- The author is not simple a cokc though because his non-streaming version works, unlike the example at Tanstack
