# Notes

## Route Groups

- https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups
- `(payload)` folder is a "route group"
  - to prevent the folder from being included in the route's URL path.
  - therefore it is not affected by any `layout` defined above it in the folder/routing tree e.g. the root layout of the main (non-admin) UI

## Templates

In terms of Component tree: is rendered BETWEEN a `layout` and its `children`
